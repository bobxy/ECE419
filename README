The code here is for the course project of University of Toronto course ECE419 Distributed System. 
The whole projects took us days and nights to finish. But the final outcomes were pretty good.

We designed our own database system from scratch.
Here are a few highlights:
We used append-only strategy, we used memory mapping file for fast I/O performance.
It offers three caching mechanisms.
It has crash recovery feature.
It also has load balance feature.
We designed our own protocol to transmit the data amongs the server and clients.

I would say this implementation can be referred as a great example.
Feel free to post any questions.
